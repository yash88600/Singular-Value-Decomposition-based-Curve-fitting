# Singular-Value-Decomposition-based-Curve-fitting

* Implemented C++ algorithms for solving Underdetermined and Overdetermined systems of equations
and applied to curve fitting for optimal parameter estimation.
* Developed C++ code for Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to carry out matrix Rank
Approximation & finding condition number
